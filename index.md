## About Me

I received my Ph.D. degree from Jiangnan University in 2024 under the supervision of [Prof. Xiao-Jun Wu](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=5IST34sAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Prof. Josef Kittler](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=pk-yb_kAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao), and Bachelor degree from Jiangnan University in 2018. I was a visiting Ph.D. student at the [Centre for Vision, Speech and Signal Processing (CVSSP)](https://www.surrey.ac.uk/centre-vision-speech-signal-processing), University of Surrey, Guildford, United Kingdom, from 2022 to 2023. 

The focus of my works is on deep learning approaches for Action Understanding. Particularly, I have focused on **Video Understanding** (Spatial Temporal Reasoning, Visual Scene Understanding), **Vision-Language Modeling**, **Low Resource Learning** (Transfer Learning/ Few-Shot Learning/ Self-Supervised Learning).
